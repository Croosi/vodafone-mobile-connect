It will also allow to send and receive short messages from your computer.  The cards currently supported are: Huawei E620, Huawei E220 and Option GlobeTrotter 3G+ EMEA<sup>[<a id="id2517834" href="#ftn.id2517834">1</a>]</sup>.</p><p>In order to use your <acronym class="acronym">3G</acronym> device, you should run a fairly recent version of the Linux kernel.  You can find out which version you are using by firing a termunal emulator (such as <span class="application">gnome-terminal</span> or <span class="application">konsole</span>) and then typing the command <span><strong class="command">uname -sr</strong></span>.  <span class="application">VMCCdfL</span> has been tested on Linux 2.6.17 and newer.  If you have an older version installed, we would recommend to update it before going on.  Your distribution of choice will most likely provide recent versions of the Linux kernel, downloadable from the Internet.</p><p>If <span class="application">Vodafone Mobile Connect Card driver for Linux</span> is not included in your distribution, you can still install it using your package system (.deb on Debian/Ubuntu-based systems, .rpm in Fedora, Mandriva, SUSE, etc).  Before doing so, make sure you have the needed dependencies installed (python-central, python-notify, python-twisted, etc).  If you use some other kind of distribution, you will probably need to install the program from its source code (see the documentation).</p><p>On Debian-based systems, your username must be a member of the "dip" group in order to be able to stablish an Internet connection.  You can find out which groups you are a member of by issuing in a console the command <span><strong class="command">groups</strong></span>.  If you are not a member of the group "dip", you can add yourself by executing <span><strong class="command">addgroup <strong class="userinput"><code>fred</code></strong> dip</strong></span>, replacing "fred" by your username.</p><p>On other systems, such as Fedora (A RedHat based distribution), you will need to have gksu o kdesu installed in order to be able to connect to the Internet.  Those programs will ask for the superuser's password before stablishing the connection.</p><p>Plug your <acronym class="acronym">3G</acronym> device to the computer, following the directions found in its userguide.  Depending on the model you own, you will have to insert it in a <acronym class="acronym">PCMCIA</acronym> slot, or attach it to the <acronym class="acronym">USB</acronym> ports.  Some Linux versions have trouble recognizing some card models.  You could need to plug and unplug several times the card, in order to the system to properly recognize it.</p><p>You are now ready to start using your <acronym class="acronym">3G</acronym> device on GNU/Linux.</p><p>Launch <span class="application">Vodafone Mobile Connect Card driver for Linux</span>.  It can be done using the desktop environment menus, or issuing this command on a terminal: <span><strong class="command">vodafone-mobile-connect-card-driver-for-linux</strong></span>.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Tip</h3><p>If you find any kind of problem while using this tool, try launching it with the command <span><strong class="command">vodafone-mobile-connect-card-driver-for-linux-debug</strong></span>.  This will show additional info on the console, which will help you to diagnose the problem.</p></div><p>First time you run the program, you will have to do the initial setup.  The program will automatically recognize the card model, but you will have to specify your preferred kind of connection.</p><div class="informalfigure"><pre class="synopsis">Initial setup</pre><div align="center"><img src="images/config.jpg" align="middle" /></div></div><p><acronym class="acronym">GPRS</acronym> (General Packet Radio System) is not a high speed connection, but as it is based on the already existing technologies, its coverage is nearly absolute.  On the other hand, <acronym class="acronym">3G</acronym> is a broadband connection, but as it is a recent technology, there are areas where it has not been deployed yet.</p><div class="informalfigure"><pre class="synopsis">Setting the technology to be used</pre><div align="center"><img src="images/config2.jpg" align="middle" /></div></div><p>Generally, it might be wise choosing the <span class="guilabel">3G preferred</span> option.  This way, the system will try to connect using <acronym class="acronym">3G</acronym> technology.  If that is not possible, it will fallback to <acronym class="acronym">GPRS</acronym>.</p><p>Over the splashscreen a popup window will ask you to enter your <acronym class="acronym">PIN</acronym> (Personal Identification Number) which was provided together with your <acronym class="acronym">SIM</acronym> card (Subscriber Identity Module).</p><div class="informalfigure"><pre class="synopsis">PIN request</pre><div align="center"><img src="images/pin.jpg" align="middle" /></div></div><p>Be careful when typing your <acronym class="acronym">PIN</acronym>; if it is introduced wrongly for three times, the card will be blocked, and you will need your <acronym class="acronym">PUK</acronym> (PIN Unblocking Key) to unblock the card.</p><div class="informalfigure"><pre class="synopsis">Wrong PIN</pre><div align="center"><img src="images/wrong-pin.jpg" align="middle" /></div></div><p>The application will then read the messages and contacts stored in your <acronym class="acronym">SIM</acronym>, and will show its main screen.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="internet"></a>Connecting to the Internet</h2></div></div></div><p>In order to connect to the Internet, press the green-colored <span class="guibutton">Connect</span> icon in the iconbar (just under the menubar).  A small window will popup, telling you that the connection is being stablished.

You can also have multiple <span class="application">wvdial</span> profiles, customizable from the application itself.</p><p>In order to use Internet services (web browsing, e-mail, chat, instant messaging, etc), just launch the appropiate programas and use them as usual.  For your convenience, VMCCdfL provides <span class="guibutton">Mail</span> and <span class="guibutton">Internet</span> icons, which will open your default e-mail client and web browser.</p><p>If you find any kind of problem while connected to the Internet, you can try the connectivy test located in the menu <span class="guimenu">Tools</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Diagnostics</span>.  This test collects information that the technical support team might find useful.</p><p>Once you have finished using the Internet, press the red-colored <span class="guibutton">Disconnect</span> button, at the very same place where the connection button used to be.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="sms"></a>Sending and receiving short messages</h2></div></div></div><p>VMCCdfL will allow you to send and receive short messages (<acronym class="acronym">SMS</acronym>) from your computer.
